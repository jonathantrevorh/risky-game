risky
========================
Simplified version of the Hasbro favorite, as tasked by CS2340. 

CSS and JavaScript constitute significant portions of the projects thanks to Bootstrap and AngularJS.

Requires
--------
- Environment Varilables
    - CATALINA\_HOME (from localhost:8080, usually /usr/share/tomcat7)
    - CATALINA\_BASE (from localhost:8080, usually /var/lib/tomcat7)

Fair warning
-----------
For the sake of simplicity, 
- "databases" are hashmaps kept in the servlet
- Business logic has been wrapped in API calls
- AngularJS Resources are pretty good for purely (and only purely) CRUD endpoints
